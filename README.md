#PDF Converter
####By Ellery Addington-White

This will convert uploaded pdf's to one long vertical jpg that is compressed(75% by default can be changed to whatever you want though). This will all be performed client side using java script. This makes for less stress on the back-end by having smaller files to deal with. It will also eliminate unnesesary data usage and network bloat with clients uploading huge pdf documents.
